## Description 
Pixie is a simple pixel art drawing web application. It lets you: 
* Dynamically choose the size of the panel
* Use random colors to color the pixels
* Export your finished art as a PNG sprite!
I made this application as a side project and cause I love pixel art! :P 

## Tech Stack

* Sass

## Output 

This is one of the sprites I created using **Pixie** ( I am not that good at pixel art xD )
